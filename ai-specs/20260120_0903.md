# 20260120_0903: Add fallback selection for --upgrade-all when asset filters don't match

Enhanced the `--upgrade-all` command to automatically fall back to the previously selected asset when current filters don't match any available assets, or when multiple candidates exist, use the previous selection automatically.

When upgrading packages, if the stored asset filters no longer match any assets in the latest release, the tool now attempts to use the previously installed asset name with the new tag. If multiple assets are available for selection, it automatically chooses the previously selected one if present in the list.

Added warning messages in yellow (ANSI color) when fallback is used to inform the user.

## Changes Made
- Added `replaceTagInURL()` function to modify GitHub release URLs with new tags
- Modified asset detection logic in `main()` to check for previous installations and apply fallback
- Added automatic selection of previous asset when prompting for multiple candidates
- Included colored warning messages for fallback usage

## Technical Details
- Loads installed configuration to retrieve previous asset and URL information
- For no-match fallback: replaces tag in previous URL and uses it directly
- For selection fallback: finds previous asset in candidate list and selects it automatically
- Uses ANSI escape codes for yellow warning text
- Preserves existing behavior when no previous installation exists
