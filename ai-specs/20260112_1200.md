# Enhanced Upgrade Functionality

## Request
Add support for additional options in the upgrade command: asset, output, download_only, verify, disable_ssl, hash, upgrade_only. Also ensure proper stdio handling in download and upgrade commands.

## Implementation
- Modified `performUpgrade` in `installed.go` to parse and apply the additional options to the command arguments.
- Added `cmd.Stdin = os.Stdin` to both `downloadConfigRepositories` in `eget.go` and `performUpgrade` in `installed.go` for proper stdio handling.
- Ensured `cmd.Stdout` and `cmd.Stderr` are set correctly.

## Details
- Options are checked for existence and type before adding to args.
- Asset option supports multiple assets.
- Output uses --to flag.
- Download_only uses --download-only.
- Verify uses --verify-sha256.
- Disable_ssl uses --disable-ssl.
- Hash uses --sha256.
- Upgrade_only uses --upgrade-only.

This allows more flexible upgrades through the config system.
