# Fuzzy Search for Interactive Upgrade-All Mode

**Date:** 20260407_1229
**Feature:** Add fuzzy search filtering to the `upgrade-all --interactive` mode

## User Request

Add fuzzy search capability to the interactive mode of the `upgrade-all` command in eget. When users have many installed packages, they need a way to quickly filter the list to find specific packages to upgrade.

## Implementation Summary

### Dependencies Added
- `github.com/sahilm/fuzzy` - Lightweight fuzzy matching library
- `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles` (already using bubbletea, added bubbles for textinput component)

### Changes to `installed.go`

#### 1. New Imports (lines 16-18)
```go
"github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles/textinput"
tea "github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea"
"github.com/sahilm/fuzzy"
```

#### 2. Extended `packageSelectModel` Struct (lines 566-576)
Added three new fields to the bubbletea model:
- `searchInput textinput.Model` - Text input component for search queries
- `searching bool` - Flag indicating if user is in search mode
- `filtered []int` - Indices of candidates matching current search

#### 3. New Helper Methods

**`Init()` method (lines 578-583)**
- Initializes the text input with placeholder "Search packages..."

**`findOrInitFiltered()` method (lines 586-594)**
- Ensures filtered list exists and resets cursor to top
- Creates initial filtered list containing all candidate indices

**`applySearchFilter()` method (lines 597-621)**
- Performs fuzzy matching using `fuzzy.Find(query, targets)` on candidate repo names
- Updates `m.filtered` with matching candidate indices
- Handles edge cases: empty query (show all), no matches (cursor at 0), cursor bounds checking

#### 4. Updated `Update()` Method (lines 623-710)

**Key Handling Restructuring:**
The key handling was restructured to check for navigation/exit keys FIRST when in search mode, before routing to the textinput component. This fixes issues where arrow keys, Enter, and Esc were being captured by the text input.

**New Key Handler:**
- `/` - Enter search mode, focus text input

**Search Mode Key Bindings:**
- **Type characters** - Add to search query, real-time filtering
- **↑/↓ or j/k** - Navigate within filtered items
- **space** - Toggle selection on current filtered item
- **Enter** - Leave search mode, keep current filter applied
- **Esc** - Leave search mode, clear filter and show all items
- **Ctrl+C** - Quit program

**Normal Mode Key Bindings (unchanged):**
- `↑/↓` or `j/k` - Navigate all items
- `space` - Toggle selection
- `a` - Select all items
- `n` - Select none
- `ctrl+d` or `enter` - Confirm and proceed
- `q` or `esc` - Quit

**Selection Logic (preserves across searches):**
- Selections use original candidate indices in `m.selected` map
- Selections persist when entering/exiting search mode
- Selections persist when applying/clearing filters

#### 5. Updated `View()` Method (lines 712-775)

**Search Bar Display:**
- Shows text input at top when `m.searching == true`
- Displays filtered results instead of all candidates when searching

**Context-Aware Help Text:**
- When searching: Shows "↑/↓: navigate items • space: toggle • enter: keep filter • esc: clear filter"
- When not searching: Shows "↑/↓ or j/k: navigate • /: search • space: toggle • a: select all • n: select none"

#### 6. Updated `selectPackagesInteractively()` Function (lines 777-805)

**Initialization Changes:**
- Changed model to pointer receiver (`&packageSelectModel{}`)
- Calls `model.Init()` to initialize text input
- Calls `model.findOrInitFiltered()` and `model.applySearchFilter()` to set up initial state
- Casts final model to `*packageSelectModel`

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Search Mode Key Priority**: Navigation keys (arrows, enter, esc, space) are handled before routing to textinput. This ensures users can navigate and select while in search mode.

2. **Enter vs Esc Distinction**:
   - **Enter**: Leaves search mode but keeps the current filter applied (cursor resets to 0)
   - **Esc**: Leaves search mode AND clears the filter (returns to full list)

3. **Selection Persistence**: Selected items remain selected when filtering/unfiltering. The `m.selected` map uses original candidate indices, so selections survive search mode transitions.

4. **Fuzzy Matching on Repo Names**: The search matches against `candidate.Repo` (e.g., "owner/repo") using the `fuzzy` library's algorithm.

5. **Real-time Filtering**: No "submit" action needed - list filters as you type.

6. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing keyboard shortcuts work exactly as before when not in search mode.

### UI Flow Examples

**Scenario 1: Filter and keep filter**
```
1. User runs: eget --upgrade-all --interactive
2. Package list displayed with checkboxes
3. User presses '/' → Search bar appears at top
4. User types "micro" → List filters to show only repos matching "*micro*"
5. User presses ↑/↓ to navigate, space to select packages
6. User presses Enter → Search mode exits, filter "micro" stays applied
7. User sees only filtered packages, can continue selecting
8. User presses ctrl+d → Confirms and proceeds
```

**Scenario 2: Filter then clear**
```
1-5. Same as Scenario 1
6. User presses Esc → Search mode exits, filter cleared, full list restored
7. User continues with all packages visible
```

**Scenario 3: Quick search and select**
```
1. User presses '/'
2. User types "fzf"
3. User navigates with ↓ to desired package
4. User presses space to select
5. User presses Enter to exit search (filter remains)
6. User presses ctrl+d to confirm
```

### Testing Notes

- Build verified: `go build -o eget` succeeds
- New dependencies: `github.com/sahilm/fuzzy v0.1.1`, `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles v1.0.0`
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Files Modified

- `/home/gmatheu/Documents/misc/eget/installed.go` - Core implementation (lines 565-805 modified)
- `/home/gmatheu/Documents/misc/eget/go.mod` - Added dependencies
- `/home/gmatheu/Documents/misc/eget/go.sum` - Updated checksums

### Bug Fixes (Update 20260407)

**Fixed: Cannot navigate or select in search mode**
- Issue: All keys were being captured by textinput component
- Fix: Restructured `Update()` to check for navigation/exit keys BEFORE routing to textinput

**Fixed: Cannot exit search mode properly**
- Issue: Enter and Esc had same behavior
- Fix: Enter now leaves search mode and keeps filter; Esc leaves search mode and clears filter

**Fixed: Arrow keys not working in search mode**
- Issue: Arrow keys were sent to textinput instead of navigating list
- Fix: Arrow keys now handled explicitly in search mode block before textinput routing

### Future Considerations

- Could extend search to match against `candidate.Entry.Target` or other fields
- Could add case-sensitive search option
- Could highlight matching characters in results (fuzzy library provides match positions)
